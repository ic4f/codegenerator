This is my thesis project for my Master's in Computer Science. It is an object-relational mapper and
code generator that generates most of the data layer code for a data driven web application. The
generated code is SQL + C# or VB.

My thesis is <a href="http:/sergey.cs.uni.edu/static/ms_thesis.pdf">available here</a>.

## What's inside
* CodeGenerator: code generator files
* CodeGeneratorTest: unit tests
* ConsoleApp: main/driver program
* demo/app_schema: a schema for a sample application
* demo/generated_code: C# classes and SQL statements generated based on the schema
