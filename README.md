This project is deprecated and is not maintained. It exists for historical reasons only.

This is a code generator that generates most of the data layer code for a data driven application. Essentially, it's an object-relational mapper (ORM). It was written in 2006-2008 and was used to generate C# code for web applications (mostly content management systems) between 2006-2011. 
It is functional, but the C# code it generates is, of course, outdated.
